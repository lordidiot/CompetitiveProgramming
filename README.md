# Competitive Programming Stuff

Getting distracted a lot so I'm kind of hopping between the different materials. But mostly going through these few courses/trainings. Hopefully can get good some day.


## CSES

### Book

* Competitive Programmer's Handbook [\[link\]](https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf)

### Problemset

* CSES Problem Set [\[link\]](https://cses.fi/problemset/) [\[my solutions\]](/CSES)


## Junior Training Sheet

* Junior Training Sheet V7.0 [\[link\]](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iJZWP2nS_OB3kCTjq8L6TrJJ4o-5lhxDOyTaocSYc-k/edit#gid=84654839)
* Made by Dr Mostafa Saad Ibrahim

Pretty interesting problem set with some accompanying teaching material (though most videos seem to be by him in Arabic), the slides are in english though.

## USACO

* USACO Training Program [\[link\]](https://train.usaco.org/)
* My solutions [\[link\]](/USACO)

Looks interesting, especially because the problems their problem set has post-solve analysis. I kind of dislike how sensitive the platform is to trailing whitespaces and stuff, but at least there is feedback so I can quickly debug the issues ( looking @ you UVa >:( ).
